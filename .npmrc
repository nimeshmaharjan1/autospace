# By default in pnpm v9+, link-workspace-packages is set to false, which causes pnpm 
# to not automatically link local workspace packages.
# This leads to a 404 error when trying to install local packages (e.g., @autospace/sample),
# as pnpm attempts to fetch them from the npm registry instead.
# To fix this, we set link-workspace-packages=true to ensure pnpm links local workspace
# packages automatically, avoiding the 404 error when adding local dependencies.
link-workspace-packages=true
